# Problem Statement:
## 1. Real-Time Fraud Detection System

### Tagline: “The Scam Stops Here – Be the Sherlock of Transactions”

### Goal: Spot the wolves before they prey. Build a system so precise, it’s like
sniffing out the fraudsters’ next move in milliseconds.

### Key Tasks:

§ Ingest live transaction data and run anomaly detection.

§ Implement machine learning (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting,
deep learning) for continuous fraud scoring.

§ Showcase a user-friendly dashboard for real-time alerts.

### Expectations:

§ [Accuracy metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)

§ [Visualization of live fraud detection.](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/)

§ [Documentation on model interpretability (e.g., SHAP, LIME).](https://stripe.com/docs/api)
